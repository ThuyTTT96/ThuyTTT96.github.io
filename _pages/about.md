Hi, I am Chloe (Thuy) Tran, a **Bioinformatics Data Analyst** at [Huntsman Cancer Institute](https://healthcare.utah.edu/huntsmancancerinstitute), University of Utah. My research focuses on applying **machine learning and AI** to single-cell RNA-seq data for drug repurposing in cancer immunotherapy.

### Current Work

At Huntsman Cancer Institute, I develop computational pipelines for:
- **Drug candidate identification** using scDrug and GDSC-based models for ICI combination strategies
- **Semi-supervised ML pipelines** to track treatment resistance using scRNA-seq data
- **Full-stack web applications** (React/Node.js, R Shiny) for interactive single-cell data visualization
- **Drug-gene interaction platforms** with 300K+ high-confidence interactions

Check out our [Interactive Single Cell Visual Analytics for Multiomics Tools (ISCVAM)](https://chenlab.chpc.utah.edu/iscvam/).

### Background

Prior to joining HCI, I worked as a **Software Engineer** at Rakuten Mobile in Tokyo, Japan, where I developed monitoring dashboards for 4G/5G RAN network infrastructure. I also conducted research on **engagement detection in online learning** using computer vision techniques at Hosei University.

### Technical Skills

- **Programming:** Python, R, Shell Script
- **ML/AI:** PyTorch, Scikit-learn, MONAI, HuggingFace, CLIP, LLM, RAG
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, Seurat, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Web Development:** React.js, Node.js, Streamlit, R Shiny
- **Tools:** Docker, Slurm, HDF5, Linux, GitHub
