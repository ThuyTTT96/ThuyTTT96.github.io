## Overview

At Rakuten Mobile, I developed an end-to-end auto-monitoring tool for 4G and 5G RAN (Radio Access Network) clusters, ensuring reliability and efficiency of the network infrastructure.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Dashboard for monitoring Linux server health across the network
- **Automated Data Collection**: Streamlit-based system for gathering system health metrics
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automated detection of network anomalies and potential issues
- **KPI Reporting**: Weekly automated reports on network performance metrics

### System Components

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Dashboard | Streamlit | Real-time visualization |
| Data Collection | Python scripts | Automated metrics gathering |
| Anomaly Detection | Python, ML | Issue identification |
| Reporting | Python, Pandas | Weekly KPI reports |

### Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python, Shell Script
- **Dashboard**: Streamlit
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Infrastructure**: Linux servers
- **Network**: 4G/5G RAN clusters

### Impact

- Improved network reliability through proactive monitoring
- Reduced manual effort in health checks and reporting
- Enhanced network performance through data-driven insights
