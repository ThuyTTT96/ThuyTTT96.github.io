## Overview

Created a comprehensive drug-gene interaction platform by integrating data from 4 major databases, standardizing gene identifiers, and delivering a curated dataset for cancer research.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Database Integration**: Aggregated data from 4 major drug-gene interaction databases
- **Gene Identifier Standardization**: Harmonized gene identifiers using HGNC and NCBI standards
- **High-Confidence Curation**: Delivered 300K+ high-confidence drug-gene interactions
- **Research-Ready Dataset**: Prepared data for downstream analysis in drug repurposing studies

### Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python, R
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Databases**: HGNC, NCBI, DrugBank, DGIdb
- **Tools**: Shell Script, Linux

### Data Sources

- Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb)
- DrugBank
- HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee)
- NCBI Gene

### Impact

This curated dataset supports ongoing research in cancer drug repurposing and combination therapy discovery at Huntsman Cancer Institute.
