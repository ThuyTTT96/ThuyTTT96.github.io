## Overview

At Huntsman Cancer Institute, I developed a comprehensive computational pipeline for identifying drug candidates targeting resistant tumor subpopulations in cancer immunotherapy.

### Key Features

- **scDrug Integration**: Applied scDrug to pre-treatment ESCC (Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma) scRNA-seq data to identify drug candidates
- **GDSC-based Predictions**: Predicted cell-death percentages using Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) models for ICI combination strategies
- **Semi-supervised ML Pipeline**: Built a pipeline to track treatment resistance using scRNA-seq data
- **Therapy Validation**: Predicted and validated candidate therapies using iDEA, integrating DSigDB and DREIMT databases

### Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python, R
- **ML Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, PyTorch
- **Bioinformatics**: Seurat, scDrug, iDEA
- **Databases**: DSigDB, DREIMT, GDSC

### Impact

This work contributed to a publication in *Pharmaceuticals* (2025) on harnessing single-cell RNA-seq for computational drug repurposing in cancer immunotherapy.
